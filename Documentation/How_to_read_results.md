# How to read the results

## Where are the results stored?

Results are stored in the *Spectrum Path* defined in the *Settings Tab*.

Results obtained for backbone resonances are kept separated from those of sidechains, in folders named *Backbone/* and *Sidechains/* respectively. We decided to separate results based on the nature of the resonances because usually they are represented separatedly. Besides this, *Backbone/* and *Sidechains/* have the same internal structure. We will use *Backbone/* as the example.
