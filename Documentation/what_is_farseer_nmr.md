Farseer-NMR is a software package that treats, remediates, calculates and plots NMR data and restraints derived from both simple and complex titration experiments; these titration experiments can span up to three different conditions. The process of handling large amounts of diverse NMR data can be tedious, repetitive, error prone and time-consuming; taking days and even weeks in some cases. Farseer-NMR removes the tedium, minimise the effect of human error and reduces the time burden to seconds/minutes. We have implemented the most common (and some not so common) calculation routines (PRE, PCS, CSP, ...) and several publication-quality plotting templates to improve data representation. Farseer-NMR written completely in Python and can read the most common NMR peaklist formats: Ansig, NmrDraw, NmrView, CYANA, XEASY, Sparky and CcpNmr Analysis 2.4 via simple drag-and-drop import. The graphical interface is written using the most up-to-date version of PyQt, PyQt v5.8, and its modular code base enables facile extension.
