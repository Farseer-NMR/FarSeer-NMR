Analyse how the different constructs affect the ensemble distribution 
by observing the PRE and Delta PRE in the different molecular contexts.

Set up an experimental tree where Z axis points are 'dia' and 'para' "magnetics",
the different constructs are set along the Y axis and the X axis,
which will contain only one data point.

The Compacted Bar plot is selected to represent the data evolution along the whole
protein. Other settings are already set up in the conf.json file.
You can also change the Settings at your will.

To run this experiment, simply create the Experimental Tree and populate it.

How to configure the Experimental Tree:
This Tree contains 2 Z datapoints, 4 Y datapoints and 1 X axis datapoint.

    - A2C
        - 278K (here we can set temperature information or any dummy name)
