This is an example of a protein-protein titration experiment
where Protein Y was probed against two concentration ratios (1:1 and 1:2)
of unlabelled Proteins H and Protein J bearing each a MTSL paramagnetic tag.

This is experimental set is not yet intended to analyse Paramagnetic data, for that
see 3D/ example folder.

The current config.json is configured to analyse the data along the X (1D)
and Y (2D) axes. Along the X axis the parameters will be analysed to
reflect the effects that Proteins H and J have in Protein Y, separately.
While along Y axis, it will be represented the DIFFERENCES between the
effects that Protein J and Y have on Protein Y at each concentration ratio.

At the end, both series are compared/stacked along the X and Y dimensions.
This feature, as indicated in the Documentation PDF, simple stacks the data
previously calculated along different axes so it can be easily compared.

The Compacted Bar plot is selected to represent the data evolution along the whole
protein, CSP and Height ratio are represented.
Other settings are already set up in the conf.json file.
You can also change the Settings at your will.

To identify the unassigned residues of Protein Y you should select the FASTA file
provided in pkls/ folder. Please recall that this FASTA file do not correspond to
Protein H or J, as these are unlabelled and are not observed. The FASTA file
corresponds to Protein Y which is the protein observed and to which peaklist refer to.

To run this experiment, simply create the Experimental Tree and populate it.
How to configure the Experimental Tree:
This Tree contains 1 Z datapoints, 2 Y datapoints and 3 X axis datapoints.
