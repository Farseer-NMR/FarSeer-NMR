This is an example of a protein-protein titration experiment
where protein1 was titrated against increasing concentration of protein2.
Protein1 concentration was fixed to 200µM and protein2 concentration
increased along the range: 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 500µM.

The current config.json is configured to analyse the data along the X axis (1D).
Open the Farseer-NMR and Load the config.json file.

In the current configuration, Chemical Shift Perturbations (CSP) will be
calculated and represented in all different plotting templates.

The Parameters Evolution per Residue Plot are selected to represent the evolution
of CSPs per residue along the titration.

The continuous CSPs data is fit to the Hill Equation
and represented in the Evolution per Residue plot. This is SIMPLY a demonstration
of the implemented fitting platform, showing how user defined fitting functions can
be implemented as a Farseer-NMR routine.

You can also change the Settings at your will.

As an advice, select the FASTA file and activate the "Apply FASTA" flag to search for
unassigned residues.

To run this experiment, simply create the Experimental Tree and populate it where
the reference peaklist should be first followed by the others in crescent order.

How to populate the Experimental Tree:
This Tree contains 1 Z axis datapoint, 1 Y axis datapoint and 7 X axis datapoints.
