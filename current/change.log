2017/04/12 -*1st revision pre-release*-
- corrected read_FASTA() to accept '>' commented lines
- correct representation of PRE analysis in C3/titvar2
- corrected repesentation of delta_pre osci
- changed 'titvar' to 'cond'
- corrected theoretical PREs being displayed for other parameters than Hratio and Vratio.
- corrected fit write_log info to file.log

2017/04/10 -*PRE Analysis Implemented*-
- finished Delta PRE heatmap representation
- finished Delta PRE oscilation representation
- added r**2 calculation in parameter evolution per residue fitting

2017/04/06 -*PRE Analysis - calculations and heatmap*-
- loads theoretical PRE file from *.pre
- loads tag position in *.pre - indicated with #<res> in first line
- PRE Anlysis is calculated only in titvar3
- calculates DELTA PRE
- implemented gauss smooth calculation from DELTA PRE
- heatmaps implemented with lateral vertical scale
- parameters for heatmap control added to farseer_user_variables.py
- added theo_pre_plot() in Titration.py
-- theoretical PRE line implemented in extended, compact and vertical bar plots
-- tag line implemented in extended, compact, vertical and heatmap plots
- parameters for theoretical PRE plot configuration added to farseer_user_variables.py
