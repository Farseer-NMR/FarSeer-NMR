# Welcome to Farseer-NMR

A fully community driven and ever growing suite to analyse datasets of **peaklist files** extracted from multivariable series of biomolecular NMR experiments. 

With Farseer-NMR, you have:

* Automatic analysis of large and multivariable NMR **peaklist files** datasets
* Peaklist parsing and treatment
* Identification of _missing_ and _unassigned_ residues
* Automatic calculation of NMR parameters
* Comprehensive organization of the output
* Large suite of publication-ready plotting templates
* Full traceability via [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) formatted log file.

## Download, Install and Update

Read [here](https://github.com/joaomcteixeira/FarSeer-NMR/wiki/Download,-Install-and-Update) on how to setup your Farseer-NMR installation - it's very easy!

## Documentation

We have a [Documentation folder](https://github.com/joaomcteixeira/FarSeer-NMR/tree/master/Documentation) where you can find a whole heap of helpful files along with the Full Documentation PDF. There is also an online a list of [helpful links](https://github.com/joaomcteixeira/FarSeer-NMR/wiki/Farseer-NMR-Helpful-links) to guide you in the use of Farseer-NMR.

## Tutorials and Examples

Currently we provide a [Tutorial folder](https://github.com/joaomcteixeira/FarSeer-NMR/tree/master/Documentation/Tutorial_Datasets) with artificial datasets that you can use to try out Farseer-NMR and understand its functionalities. Tutorials explanation can be found in the [Full Documentation PDF](https://github.com/joaomcteixeira/FarSeer-NMR/blob/master/Documentation/Farseer-NMR_Documentation.pdf).

## Participate in the Farseer-NMR community

There are several ways that you can help us improve Farseer-NMR and be part of its community! :-)  

### Reporting a bug

If you find bugs, mis-functional or non-functional features during your calculation runs, please report them by using the [Issues tab](https://github.com/joaomcteixeira/FarSeer-NMR/issues). We have prepared a set of labels that help you to specify the nature of the issues. You can use the [Issues tab](https://github.com/joaomcteixeira/FarSeer-NMR/issues) to suggest new features that you would like us to implement or that you would like help implementing.

### Become a collaborator

Help us implement new features! Do you have your own NMR analysis routines that you would like to see implemented in Farseer-NMR? You can fork the [Farseer-NMR project](https://github.com/joaomcteixeira/FarSeer-NMR) to your own GitHub account, write the functionalities and prepare a pull request for us to review and help you out! We have prepared a [Farseer coding style guide](https://github.com/joaomcteixeira/FarSeer-NMR/blob/master/Documentation/Code_Style_Guide_for_Developers.md) for developers so that we keep code readability consistent. We kindly request that contributors to the project adhere to this style guide.

Even if you're not an experienced programmer, please get contact with us and we will be happy join forces with you to introduce your functionalities!

### Mailing list
