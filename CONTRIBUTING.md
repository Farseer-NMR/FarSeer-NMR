## Projects

All discussions regarding Farseer-NMR major developments, bug reporting and triage and general discussions are registered in [our projects](https://github.com/Farseer-NMR/FarSeer-NMR/projects) page, feel free to browse them. _How do we organize our projects?_ Opened issues are catalogued in projects and consequently closed if an inmediate action is not expected, they are then reopened once under development. Project's "Done" columns identify finished tasks.
