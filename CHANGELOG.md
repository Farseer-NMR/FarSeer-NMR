# version 0.7.0

Changes in version 0.7.0 were mainly changes under the hood with the aim to improve Farseer-NMR modular workflow and correct outdated code.  

Farseermain.py methods now mostly required fsuv module with user variales.  
Farseermain is now simplier.  

Functions were improved, deprecrated and created in every library.  

Many *checking* functions were implemented, WET list now has 22 items.

Added Docstrings all over the code.

## TODO
* Compatiibility between this module and JSON file as not yet been written.
